## Hello, this mini project is my practice and implementation of [this test task](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qUzx0m_Koj83k_G8BScCNK7opazbuDzk/view).


In this test assignment, I have completed all tasks up to section 2.9. I plan to tackle the remaining sections shortly, as I aim to complete a certain number of test assignments in the near future.

Regarding task 2.10, I have [experience](https://github.com/Asgef/gwent_website) working with media files, both in local and remote storage solutions. Render.com does not support media file handling on the free tier. Therefore, I intend to deploy this project on my own VDS server and use it as an opportunity to practice working with Docker.

The assignment is very engaging, and I have some ideas on how to further enhance it.

The project is hosted on Render, and you can review it [there](https://abz-agency-test-task-l2u9.onrender.com).
